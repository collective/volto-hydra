# Container Blocks

Container blocks hold other blocks inside them — sliders with slides, grids with columns, accordions with panels. Define them in your `blockSchema` using `blocks_layout` or `object_list` widgets.

---

## blocks_layout: Typed Child Blocks

Each child has its own `@type` and schema (from `blocks`). Children are stored in a shared `blocks` dict on the parent, with the field holding `{ items: [...] }` for ordering:

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
// Schema definition
slides: {
    title: 'Slides',
    widget: 'blocks_layout',
    allowedBlocks: ['slide', 'image'],
    defaultBlockType: 'slide',
    maxLength: 10,
}

// Resulting data
{
  "@type": "slider",
  "blocks": {
    "slide-1": { "@type": "slide", "title": "First" },
    "slide-2": { "@type": "image", "url": "..." }
  },
  "slides": { "items": ["slide-1", "slide-2"] }
}
```

All `blocks_layout` fields on the same block share the same `blocks` dict.

## Multiple blocks fields (regions)

A container can declare more than one **blocks field** — each a schema property with `widget: 'blocks_layout'`, with its own `allowedBlocks`. The field name is the key inside the container's shared `blocks_layout` dict; the default field is `items`. Every field's children still live in the single shared `blocks` dict — the fields only partition *ordering*.

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
// Schema definition — a page with a header, main content, and a footer
properties: {
    header: { widget: 'blocks_layout', title: 'Header', allowedBlocks: ['slate', 'image'], maxLength: 3 },
    items:  { widget: 'blocks_layout', allowedBlocks: ['slate', 'image'] },
    footer: { widget: 'blocks_layout', title: 'Footer', allowedBlocks: ['slate', 'link'] },
}

// Resulting data — ONE shared blocks dict, one list per blocks field
{
  "blocks": {
    "header-1": { "@type": "image" },
    "hero-1":   { "@type": "slate" },
    "footer-1": { "@type": "slate" }
  },
  "blocks_layout": {
    "header": ["header-1"],
    "items":  ["hero-1"],
    "footer": ["footer-1"]
  }
}
```

Each blocks field has its own `allowedBlocks` / `maxLength`. A declared field appears in the editor even when empty (it gets a seeded empty block so it is editable and a drop target).

### Why these persist (and separate top-level fields don't)

The blocks fields live as **keys inside the registered `blocks_layout` dict** rather than as separate top-level fields (the older `header_blocks` / `footer_blocks` style) for one concrete reason: **persistence**.

The backend deserializer only saves values for **registered fields**. `blocks` and `blocks_layout` are registered behavior fields, so the entire `blocks_layout` dict — every list inside it — is stored verbatim. An ad-hoc top-level field like `footer_blocks` is **not** a registered field, so the backend **silently drops it on save**. (A footer might still appear on the live site if a layout template re-injects it on every load — but that footer is never actually persisted.) Keeping every blocks field inside the registered `blocks_layout` dict makes them all persist for real.

## object_list: Items Sharing One Schema

All items share one inline schema, stored as an array with an ID field. Use `dataPath` when the data is nested within the block:

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
// Schema
slides: {
    title: 'Slides',
    widget: 'object_list',
    idField: '@id',
    dataPath: ['data', 'rows'],  // optional path when data is nested
    schema: {
        properties: {
            title: { title: 'Title' },
            image: { title: 'Image', widget: 'image' },
            description: { title: 'Description', widget: 'slate' },
        }
    }
}

// Resulting data (note: nested under dataPath)
{
  "@type": "slider",
  "data": {
    "slides": [
      { "@id": "slide-1", "title": "First", "image": "..." },
      { "@id": "slide-2", "title": "Second", "image": "..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

## object_list with allowedBlocks: Typed Items

When `allowedBlocks` is set on an `object_list`, items can have different types (like `blocks_layout`) but are still stored as an array. Each item's type is stored in the field specified by `typeField` (defaults to `'@type'`) and its schema is looked up from `blocks`:

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
facets: {
    title: 'Facets',
    widget: 'object_list',
    allowedBlocks: ['checkboxFacet', 'selectFacet'],
    typeField: 'type',
    defaultBlockType: 'checkboxFacet',
}

// Resulting data
{
  "@type": "search",
  "facets": [
    { "@id": "facet-1", "type": "checkboxFacet",
      "title": "Content Type", "field": "portal_type" },
    { "@id": "facet-2", "type": "selectFacet",
      "title": "Subject", "field": "Subject" }
  ]
}
```

Both `blocks_layout` and `object_list` look the same in the editing UI and blocks can be dragged between them — data is automatically adapted when moving between formats (ID fields added/stripped, type fields set appropriately).

## Rendering Containers in Your Frontend

Add `data-block-uid` to each child element. You don't need to mark the container element itself:

<!-- codeExample: html -->
```html
<div class="slider" data-block-uid="slider-1">
  <div class="slide" data-block-uid="slide-1"
       data-block-add="right">
    <img src="/news.jpg"/>
    <h2>Big News</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="slide" data-block-uid="slide-2"
       data-block-add="right">
    ...
  </div>
  <a data-block-selector="-1">Prev</a>
  <a data-block-selector="+1">Next</a>
</div>
```

- **`data-block-add="bottom|right"`** — Controls where the '+' button appears. By default it will be the opposite of its parent. Use "bottom" for vertical stacking, "right" for horizontal.
- **`data-block-selector="-1|+1|blockId"`** — Tag paging buttons so sidebar selection can navigate paged containers.
- **`data-block-selector="uid1 uid2 uid3 …"`** — Space-separated list of uids this element should "expose" when any of them is selected from the admin. The bridge matches with the CSS word-list operator (`[data-block-selector~=...]`), so one trigger can cover many descendants. Use it on a disclosure trigger (collapsed details, accordion header, hidden tab panel button) so that picking any block within from the sidebar opens / scrolls / activates the enclosing container. For `<summary>` triggers the bridge sets `details.open = true` directly (idempotent — won't toggle an already-open disclosure); for everything else it `.click()`s the trigger, skipping the click if `aria-expanded="true"`. The contextNavigation `<summary>` and accordion panel buttons use this pattern; the carousel `+1` / `-1` / specific-slide-uid form above is a special case of the same attribute.

## Table Mode

Set `addMode: 'table'` for table-like structures (rows containing cells). This lets users add and remove columns as easily as rows:

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
rows: {
    widget: 'object_list',
    idField: 'key',
    addMode: 'table',
    dataPath: ['table', 'rows'],
    schema: {
        properties: {
            cells: {
                widget: 'object_list',
                idField: 'key',
                schema: {
                    properties: {
                        value: { title: 'Content',
                                 widget: 'slate' }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Empty Blocks

A container can never be empty. When the last child is deleted, either the `defaultBlockType` is added, or a special block with `@type: "empty"` is inserted. Empty blocks are stripped before saving. Render them as empty space — Hydra puts a '+' button in the middle for the user to replace it.

You can override the look of the '+' button by rendering something inside the empty block and adding `data-block-add="button"` to it.

## Synchronised Block Types in a Container

You can have one container type whose children are all kept the same `@type`, with the editor picking that type once on the parent. When the type changes, every child is converted (using each child's `fieldMappings`); when a new child is added it gets the selected type.

Declare `itemTypeField` on the *blocks field* — its value names a sibling field on the same schema whose value drives every child's `@type`. The sibling field is typically rendered with `widget: 'blockTypeSelect'`, which computes its `choices` from the blocks field's `allowedBlocks` at render time:

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
blocks: {
    gridBlock: {
        blockSchema: {
            properties: {
                slides: {
                    widget: 'blocks_layout',
                    itemTypeField: 'variation',         // sync trigger
                    allowedBlocks: ['teaser', 'image'],
                },
                variation: {
                    widget: 'blockTypeSelect',          // dropdown
                },
            },
        },
    },
    teaser: {
        fieldMappings: {
            '@default': { '@id': 'href', 'title': 'title', 'image': 'preview_image' },
        },
    },
    image: {
        fieldMappings: {
            '@default': { '@id': 'href', 'title': 'alt', 'image': 'url' },
        },
    },
}
```

The relationship is local: read the schema and you can see "the children of `slides` get their `@type` from `variation`" right next to the field declaration. Works the same for `widget: 'blocks_layout'` and `widget: 'object_list'` children.

### Field-value syncing

On top of type syncing you can also have field _values_ centrally controlled at the parent — set once on the parent, applied to every child. Add ONE enhancer on the parent:

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
gridBlock: {
    blockSchema: {
        properties: {
            slides: { widget: 'blocks_layout', itemTypeField: 'variation', allowedBlocks: ['teaser', 'image'] },
            variation: { widget: 'blockTypeSelect' },
        },
    },
    schemaEnhancer: { inheritSchemaFrom: {} },
}
```

`inheritSchemaFrom` does two things automatically:

1. Surfaces the **parent-claimed** fields on the parent's sidebar under an "Item Defaults" fieldset.
2. Auto-hides the same fields on every child's sidebar (via a `hideParentOwnedFields` enhancer that's applied to every block at INIT — no per-child opt-in).

The parent declares **what it claims** per child block type via `parentControlled`. If absent, the default is: parent claims everything _not_ listed in the child's `fieldMappings['@default']` mapping. The default works for typical cases; set `parentControlled` only when you want a different split (e.g. keep a meta-toggle field editable per-child):

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
listing: {
    schemaEnhancer: {
        inheritSchemaFrom: {
            typeField: 'variation',
            mappingField: 'fieldMapping',
            // Only these fields are claimed by listing for teaser children.
            // The rest (including teaser's `overwrite` toggle) stay editable.
            parentControlled: {
                teaser: ['head_title', 'openLinkInNewTab', 'styles'],
            },
        },
    },
}
```

When `parentControlled[childType]` is set, it **replaces** the `@default` fallback for that child type. Both sides — the parent's "Item Defaults" fieldset and the child's hidden fields — are computed from the same single rule, so they can never get out of sync.

### Recipe options

- **`inheritSchemaFrom`** — schemaEnhancer recipe; surfaces parent-claimed fields on the parent and hides them on children.
- **`itemTypeField`** — declared on a `blocks_layout`/`object_list` field; names the sibling field whose value drives every child's `@type`.
- **`typeField`** — names the sibling field directly on `inheritSchemaFrom`. Use this when there is no blocks field to declare `itemTypeField` on (e.g. listings — see [Listings](listings.md)).
- **`mappingField`** — name of the field where a per-block `fieldMapping` override is stored. Required for the `FieldMappingWidget` to appear.
- **`parentControlled`** — `{ childType: [fieldName, ...] }` per-child-type override. Replaces the `fieldMappings['@default']` fallback.
- **`defaultsField`** — prefix for the inherited fields on the parent's "Item Defaults" fieldset (default: `'itemDefaults'`).
- **`blockTypeSelect`** widget options:
  - **`blocksField`** — which sub-blocks field's `allowedBlocks` to use for the choices. Auto-discovers if omitted. Set to `'..'` when the choices should come from the *enclosing parent's* `allowedSiblingTypes`.
  - **`filterConvertibleFrom`** — only offer types whose `fieldMappings` accept the named source. Typically `'@default'` for listings (every item type must be populatable from canonical content fields).
