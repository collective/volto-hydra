# Custom Blocks

Define custom block types directly in your frontend configuration via the `blocks` option in `initBridge`. No Volto plugin deployment required. Each block type needs an `id`, `title`, and a `blockSchema` with its field properties.

## `initBridge()` Reference

`initBridge(options)` opens the iframe bridge and registers your frontend's page and block configuration with the admin. Call it once during page setup when running inside the admin iframe.

```js
import { initBridge } from '@hydra-js/hydra.js';

const bridge = initBridge({
  page:        { /* page-level blocks fields */ },
  blocks:      { /* block type registry */ },
  voltoConfig: { /* other Volto settings */ },
  onEditChange: (formData) => { /* re-render on edit */ },
  pathToApiPath: (path) => path,
  debug: false,
});
```

### `page` — page-level blocks fields

Defines the **blocks fields of a page** where blocks can live. `page.schema.properties` is keyed by field name; each `widget: 'blocks_layout'` entry is one blocks field. The field name is the key inside the page's `blocks_layout` dict (the default field is `items`), so they all persist inside the registered `blocks_layout` field.

```js
page: {
  schema: {
    properties: {
      items:  { widget: 'blocks_layout', title: 'Content', allowedBlocks: ['slate', 'image', 'slider'] },
      header: { widget: 'blocks_layout', title: 'Header',  allowedBlocks: ['slate'], maxLength: 3 },
      footer: { widget: 'blocks_layout', title: 'Footer',  allowedBlocks: ['slate', 'link'] },
    },
  },
}
```

Per-field options:

- **`title`** — sidebar section title (defaults to the field name).
- **`allowedBlocks`** — array of block-type names this region accepts. Acts as a per-region filter on top of the registry.
- **`allowedTemplates`** — array of template URLs shown in the BlockChooser's "Templates" group for this field. See [Templates](templates.md).
- **`allowedLayouts`** — array of template URLs shown in the Layout dropdown for this field.
- **`maxLength`** — maximum number of blocks in the field.

Defaults and side effects:

- If you don't include `blocks_layout`, it's auto-added with `{ title: 'Blocks' }`.
- The sidebar shows one section per field when no block is selected.
- **Auto-restrict**: any block type that's not in *any* field's `allowedBlocks` is auto-restricted (hidden from the BlockChooser globally). To bypass, set the block's `restricted` to a function instead of `true`/`false`.
- Fields not present in saved page data are auto-initialised with `{ items: [] }` on load.
- You can't currently change the page metadata schema itself — custom content types are created via "Site Setup > Content types" in Volto.

### `blocks` — block type registry

Defines or overrides individual block types. Each key is the block type name (matching what appears in `allowedBlocks` and `@type` on saved blocks).

```js
blocks: {
  slider: {                          // new custom block
    id: 'slider',
    title: 'Slider',
    icon: 'data:...',
    group: 'common',
    mostUsed: true,
    blockSchema: { properties: { /* fields */ } },
  },
  slate: {                           // override the built-in slate block
    blockSchema: { /* override */ },
  },
}
```

Per-block options (most are passed through to Volto's block config):

- **`id`** — block type identifier (matches the key).
- **`title`** — display name in the BlockChooser.
- **`icon`** — icon shown in the BlockChooser (data URL or SVG component).
- **`group`** — chooser group (e.g. `'common'`).
- **`restricted`** — `true` hides the block from the chooser; can also be a function for conditional restrictions.
- **`mostUsed`** — pin to the top of the chooser.
- **`disableCustomSidebarEditForm`** — set `true` to use only the schema form in the sidebar (no custom edit component).
- **`blockSchema`** — JSON-schema-style definition of the block's fields. See [Schema Enhancers](#schema-enhancers) below and the [Block reference](examples/README.md).
- **`fieldMappings`** — block-to-block conversion rules. See [Block Conversion & fieldMappings](#block-conversion--fieldmappings) below.
- **`schemaEnhancer`** — recipe-based schema modifier; supports `fieldRules`, `inheritSchemaFrom`, etc. See [Schema Enhancers](#schema-enhancers).

`page` and `blocks` interact via name lookup: a region's `allowedBlocks: ['slate', 'slider']` references keys of the `blocks` registry. You can use one without the other — `page` alone restricts placement of built-in blocks; `blocks` alone registers custom types and gets a default `blocks_layout` region accepting everything.

### Other top-level options

- **`onEditChange(formData)`** — callback invoked with the new form data whenever the editor changes anything. See [Live Preview › Setting Up the Bridge](live-preview.md#setting-up-the-bridge).
- **`pathToApiPath(path)`** — function transforming a frontend path to the API/admin path on `PATH_CHANGE` messages. Use when your frontend embeds state (paging, filters) in URL segments that don't exist on the CMS side. See [Listings › Path Transformation](listings.md#path-transformation-pathtoapipath).
- **`voltoConfig`** — passes additional Volto config (non-block settings) through to the admin. Future home for things like slate formats ([TODO #109](https://github.com/collective/volto-hydra/issues/109)) and toolbar actions.
- **`debug`** — `true` enables verbose console logging in the bridge. Default `false`.

### Returns

The `Bridge` instance, which exposes additional API methods you can call from the frontend (e.g. `getAccessToken()`, `sendBlockUpdate()`, `sendBlockAction()`). See [Advanced › Custom Sidebar UI](advanced.md#custom-sidebar-and-cms-ui) for those.

## Defining a custom block

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
const bridge = initBridge({
    page: {
        schema: {
            properties: {
                blocks_layout: {
                    title: 'Content',
                    allowedBlocks: ['slate', 'image', 'video', 'slider'],
                },
            },
        },
    },
    blocks: {
        slider: {
            id: 'slider',
            title: 'Slider',
            icon: 'data:...',
            group: 'common',
            restricted: false,
            mostUsed: true,
            disableCustomSidebarEditForm: false,
            blockSchema: {
                properties: {
                    slider_timing: {
                        title: 'Delay',
                        widget: 'float',
                    },
                    slides: {
                        title: 'Slides',
                        widget: 'blocks_layout',
                        allowedBlocks: ['slide', 'image'],
                        defaultBlockType: 'slide',
                    }
                },
            }
        },
        slide: {
            id: 'slide',
            title: 'Slide',
            blockSchema: {
                properties: {
                    url: { title: 'Link', widget: 'url' },
                    title: { title: 'Title' },
                    image: { title: 'Image', widget: 'image' },
                    description: { title: 'Description',
                                   widget: 'slate' },
                },
            },
        },
    },
});
```

Child block types (like `slide` above) must be defined at the top level of `blocks`. You can also:

- Set `restricted: true` to hide a block from the block chooser (only usable as child blocks)
- Set `mostUsed: true` to pin a block to the top of the chooser
- Set `disableCustomSidebarEditForm: true` to use only the schema form in the sidebar (no custom edit component)
- Use `fieldsets` in the schema to organize fields into tabs

**A `widget: 'slate'` field holds one top-level node.** A slate field — like `description` on the `slide` above — stores a single paragraph, heading, or list, not a document of several. Pasting or typing multiple paragraphs into it flattens them back into one node; only the built-in `slate` *block* splits multi-node content into separate blocks. Design slate fields for single-node content, and use a `blocks_layout`/`object_list` of `slate` blocks when you need several. See [Visual Editing › One top-level node per slate field](visual-editing.md#one-top-level-node-per-slate-field).

**Worked example:** [Heading Block](./examples/heading.md) — roughly the smallest custom block there is: one field, one annotation.

## Inline-editable fields: annotation and schema must agree

A field is inline-editable only when BOTH halves are in place. They are easy to
get out of step, because each half looks fine on its own.

**1. Your markup renders something to click**, annotated with the field name:

```html
<h3 data-edit-text="title">Sydney Opera House</h3>
```

An *empty* field still has to render its element in edit mode — the editor
reveals empty fields by marking them `data-empty` and drawing a "Click to edit"
placeholder, and it can only mark an element that exists. A field that renders
nothing when empty can never be filled in on the canvas. (In view mode, render
nothing — the annotations are edit-mode only.)

Text with no box on screen is not inline-editable at all: a `.sr-only` element
is clipped to 1×1, so there is nothing to put a cursor in. Leave it unannotated
and let the sidebar edit it.

**2. Your schema declares that field as text.** The bridge will not make a field
editable unless its schema says it is one:

```javascript
properties: {
    title:       { title: 'Title', type: 'string' },
    description: { title: 'Description', type: 'string', widget: 'textarea' },
    body:        { title: 'Body', widget: 'slate' },
}
```

`type` is the DATA type (`string`, `array`, `object`, `boolean`) and `widget` is
the editor. Do not put a widget name in `type` — `{ type: 'textarea' }` is not a
textarea field, and the bridge will silently refuse to make it editable, with no
error and no clue in the DOM. Either declare both (`type: 'string', widget:
'textarea'`) or the widget alone.

`block-sanity` checks both halves: every schema text field visible on screen has
to be annotated, and every annotated field has to become editable and take the
caret when clicked.

## Widgets hydra registers

A schema names a widget by string, so anything in `config.widgets.widget` is
available — Volto's own included (`select_querystring_field`, `query_sort_on`,
`object_browser`, …). These are the ones hydra adds:

| widget | picks | documented |
|---|---|---|
| `blockTypeSelect` | which block type a container's item is | [container blocks](container-blocks.md#blocktypeselect-widget-options) |
| `schemaFieldSelect` | a field of a CONTENT TYPE, from `/@types` | [listings](listings.md) |
| `vocabularySelect` | WHICH vocabulary (not a term from one) | below |
| `blockSelect` | another BLOCK on the page, storing a field of it | below |
| `querystringSelect` | catalog indexes, one or several | below |
| `field_mapping` | how one block's fields map onto another's | [fieldMappings](#block-conversion--fieldmappings) |

Three more are swapped in rather than named: `url`, `blocks_layout` and
`object_list` replace Volto's own so the bridge can handle them.

Reach for a Volto widget first where one fits; each section below says when it
does.

## Picking a vocabulary (`vocabularySelect`)

A field can reference a vocabulary — "suggest this answer from the site's
keywords", "offer these states". Volto has widgets for picking a **term from** a
vocabulary; it has none for picking **which vocabulary**, and the reason is
structural rather than an oversight:

- Vocabularies are named utilities, and `GET /@vocabularies` lists them all.
- But it answers `{"@id", "title"}` per item, while Volto's vocabulary reducer
  reads `{token, title}` — so a built-in select aimed at the listing shows every
  name and stores `undefined`.

`vocabularySelect` reads the listing itself and keeps the **name** (the last
segment of `@id`), which is what every consumer accepts — `@vocabularies/<name>`,
Volto's `getVocabulary`, a schema's `vocabulary: { "@id": … }`.

```js
suggest_from: {
  title: 'Suggest from',
  widget: 'vocabularySelect',
  // Optional: only offer vocabularies whose NAME matches this expression.
  vocabularyFilter: 'Keywords|Subject',
}
```

The stored value is a name (`plone.app.vocabularies.Keywords`), not a URL, so
content does not carry one environment's origin.

### What it deliberately does not offer

**Catalog queries.** A query is not a list of terms. "Content matching these
criteria" belongs to a listing's `querystring`, which has its own widget.

**Field-bound sources.** In `zope.schema` a vocabulary *is* a source, and
`@sources/<field>` will even enumerate one when it is `IIterableSource` — the
same serializer answers both. But a source has no name to store: it is
identified by a field on an object (`field.bind(context).source`), so nothing
registers it and nothing can list it. `@sources` and `@querysources` also
require the `plone.restapi.vocabularies` permission (Manager / Site
Administrator), while `@vocabularies` is `zope2.View` — so an anonymous visitor
filling in a form can read a vocabulary and can never read a source.

### Searching a vocabulary

`@vocabularies/<name>` supports `?title=` (a case-insensitive substring filter,
applied server-side) and `b_start` / `b_size` batching. A type-ahead should send
`?title=` per keystroke rather than fetch every term — a long vocabulary is
exactly the case where a list is the wrong control.

## Picking another block (`blockSelect`)

A field that names **another block** — "show this question when THAT one is
answered" — should offer a menu, not ask for a uid. `blockSelect` reads
`blockPathMap`, the same container/region map the editor uses, and stores a
**field of the block chosen**.

```js
show_when_when: {
  title: 'Show when',
  widget: 'blockSelect',
  scope: 'siblings',      // 'siblings' (default) | '..' (parent's siblings) | '<region>'
  direction: 'before',    // only blocks earlier than this one
  blockTypes: ['text', 'select', 'single_choice'],
  valueField: 'field_id', // what to STORE (default: the block's own id)
  labelField: 'label',    // what to SHOW  (falls back to title, label, @type)
}
```

`valueField` is the part worth understanding. A rule is evaluated against the
value a field submits — a form question's `field_id` — so storing the block's
uid would produce a rule that reads correctly in the sidebar and never matches
anything. Name the field the consumer actually resolves.

`direction: 'before'` is what keeps skip logic honest: a question cannot depend
on an answer given after it, and the first question has nothing to depend on at
all (the menu is then empty rather than wrong).

### Not the same as `schemaFieldSelect`

| | `schemaFieldSelect` | `blockSelect` |
|---|---|---|
| choices | the CONTENT TYPE's schema fields, from `/@types` | blocks on the page, from `blockPathMap` |
| scope | the whole type | relative — siblings, `..`, a named region |
| stores | the field name | any field of the chosen block |

They share only their tail (build choices, hand them to the select). One asks
the backend what a content type looks like; the other walks the block tree in
the editor.

## Picking a catalog index (`querystringSelect`)

A field that names a catalog index — what a listing sorts on, what a facet
filters by — should offer the site's indexes, not a text box. A typo in a text
box produces a sort option that appears in the menu and silently sorts nothing.

One widget covers both shapes: `multiple: false` (the default) stores one index
name, `multiple: true` stores a chosen subset in the author's order.

`indexes: "sortable"` (also the default) offers only what the catalog can sort
on. That list is worth taking as given rather than deriving: index type sets the
floor — a KeywordIndex like `Subject` is multi-valued and has no single key to
sort by, a ZCTextIndex is ranked text — but Plone layers judgment on top. In its
registry `portal_type` and `review_state` are both `FieldIndex`, and only
`review_state` is flagged sortable. Filtering an index list by type would offer
things Plone deliberately does not.

**Volto's own widgets, for comparison.** Both are registered and pass straight
through a hydra schema:

| widget | for |
|---|---|
| [`query_sort_on`](https://github.com/plone/volto/blob/main/packages/volto/src/components/manage/Widgets/QuerySortOnWidget.jsx) | ONE index to sort by — a menu grouped by the registry's `group` |
| `select_querystring_field` | ONE index to query on (what the facet examples use) |

Prefer `query_sort_on` for a single sort field in a schema that also carries a
`querystring` field, where its grouped menu is nicer and the data is already
loaded. Prefer this widget otherwise, and for every `multiple` case.

The reason for "already loaded": `query_sort_on` reads
`state.querystring.sortable_indexes` but never dispatches `getQuerystring()` —
in Volto's listing sidebar the `QueryWidget` beside it does the asking. Alone in
a hydra schema it renders an empty menu with no error. This widget asks for
itself.

Volto has no declarative answer at all for the `multiple` case: its search block
builds that field imperatively in `SearchBlockEdit`, which writes
`sortOnOptions.items.choices` before rendering — a route a JSON schema cannot
take.

```json
"sortOnOptions": {
  "title": "Sort-by options",
  "type": "array",
  "widget": "querystringSelect",
  "indexes": "sortable",
  "multiple": true
}
```

| option | meaning |
|---|---|
| `indexes` | `"sortable"` (default) offers only what the catalog can sort on; `"all"` offers every queryable index |
| `multiple` | `true` stores an array — a chosen subset, in the author's order, which is what a "sort by" menu is |
| `emptyLabel` | wording of the "none" entry in single mode (default `— no sorting —`). Single mode needs one: no sorting is a real answer, usually the default. Ignored when `multiple`, where an empty list says it already |

The stored value is the index NAME (`effective`, `sortable_title`), because that
is what a query is built from; the title is only what the author reads.

`@querystring` is loaded once for the whole editor, so the widget asks for it
only if nothing else has, and shows an empty menu — not a crash — while it is
still in flight.



## Schema Enhancers

Schema enhancers modify block schemas dynamically:

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
const bridge = initBridge({
    blocks: {
        myBlock: {
            blockSchema: {
                properties: {
                    mode: {
                        title: 'Mode', widget: 'select',
                        choices: [['simple', 'Simple'], ['advanced', 'Advanced']],
                    },
                    advancedOptions: { title: 'Advanced Options', type: 'string' },
                },
            },
            schemaEnhancer: {
                fieldRules: {
                    advancedOptions: { when: { mode: 'advanced' }, else: false },
                },
            },
        },
    },
});
```

**`fieldRules`** — add, remove, or conditionally modify field definitions. The value for each rule key can be:

- `false` — always hide the field
- `{ set: { title: '...', widget: '...' } }` — always add or replace the field definition
- `{ when: { fieldName: value }, else: false }` — show only when condition met
- `{ when: { fieldName: { gte: 2 } }, set: { ... } }` — conditional definition override
- `[rule, rule, ...]` — switch: first matching rule wins. A bare `false` in the array is a catch-all hide: `[{ when: A }, { when: B }, false]` shows on A or B, hides otherwise.
- `'parent.child': false` — hide a field inside a widget's inner schema

Condition operators: `is`, `isNot`, `isSet`, `isNotSet`, `oneOf`, `notOneOf`, `contains`, `notContains`, `containsAny`, `notContainsAny`, `containsAll`, `notContainsAll`, `regex`, `notRegex`, `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`. A bare value (`{ mode: 'advanced' }`) is shorthand for `is`.

Each operator is driven by the field's **declared type**, never the value shape. A field reduces to one of four **surfaces**, and an operator used off its surface raises an error (a mis-authored rule fails loudly rather than silently mismatching):

| surface | fields | operators |
|---|---|---|
| **string** | text, textarea, url, Choice, **slate** (its plaintext) | `is`/`isNot`, `isSet`, `oneOf`/`notOneOf`, `contains`/`notContains` = **substring**, `regex`/`notRegex` |
| **number** | integer, float, number | `is`/`isNot`, `oneOf`, `isSet`, `gt`/`gte`/`lt`/`lte` = compare |
| **boolean** | boolean | `is`/`isNot`, `isSet` |
| **array** | multiselect (its values), **region** (its child block **types**) | `isSet`, `is`/`isNot` = **set-equality**, `contains`/`notContains` = membership, `containsAny`/`containsAll` (+inverses), `gt`/`gte`/`lt`/`lte` = **count** |

`oneOf` (scalar value ∈ set) and `containsAny` (array shares any with a set) differ only on the field side — `oneOf` is for a single-valued field, `containsAny` for a multiselect; `oneOf` on an array throws (use `containsAny`).

Two extras drive **position-** and **type-**aware rules:

- The virtual field **`@index`** reads a block's ordinal position within its parent `object_list` region (a `number` surface) — `{ '@index': { lt: 1 } }` means "first in my region", and `../@index` is the parent block's index. Distinct from a region's `count` (which counts children).
- A rule whose **`set` is a block-type NAME** (a string) rather than a field definition is a **`@type` rule** — it changes the item's *type* by position, not a field. Declared as `typeRule` on a typed `object_list`; see [`typeRule` — position picks a typed item's `@type`](#typerule--position-picks-a-typed-items-type). The retype is applied by CONVERSION (a schema enhancer can't rewrite stored `@type`), which brings up the confirm described under [Drag / paste via conversion](#drag--paste-via-conversion).

```javascript
schemaEnhancer: {
    fieldRules: {
        // multiselect `elements: ['image','date','tag']` — reveal each option's field
        date: { when: { elements: { contains: 'date' } }, else: false },
        media: { when: { elements: { containsAny: ['image', 'video'] } }, else: false },
        layout: { when: { elements: { containsAll: ['image', 'date'] } }, else: false },
        // scalar Choice
        invert: { when: { colour: { oneOf: ['brand-dark', 'black'] } }, else: false },
        // text: substring / pattern
        cta: { when: { title: { contains: 'Sale' } }, else: false },
        year: { when: { title: { regex: { pattern: '\\b20\\d\\d\\b', flags: 'i' } } }, else: false },
    },
}
```

For a **region** (an `object_list` field, or a single `blocks_layout` region named by its region key), the array surface is its **child block types**, and the numeric operators **count** that region's children — only its own, never a cross-region total:

```javascript
schemaEnhancer: {
    fieldRules: {
        // reveal a caption field only when the `body` region has an image block
        caption: { when: { body: { contains: 'image' } }, else: false },
        // offer "columns layout" only once the `columns` region has ≥2 blocks
        columnsLayout: { when: { columns: { gte: 2 } }, else: false },
        // "carousel options" only when the `slides` object_list has >1 item
        carouselOptions: { when: { slides: { gt: 1 } }, else: false },
    },
}
```

To condition on a block's **position** rather than a field value, use the virtual field **`@index`** — a block's ordinal index within its parent `object_list` region (a `number` surface). It composes with the block-step grammar, so `../@index` is the parent block's index. Unlike the region's numeric ops (which *count* children), `@index` is *where this block sits*:

```javascript
schemaEnhancer: {
    fieldRules: {
        // a table cell's blocks region: cap at one block when this cell is in the
        // first row (a header row) — `../@index` is the cell's ROW index
        blocks: [
            { when: { '../../headerMode': { oneOf: ['row', 'both'] }, '../@index': { lt: 1 } }, set: { maxLength: 1 } },
            { when: { '../../headerMode': { oneOf: ['col', 'both'] }, '@index':    { lt: 1 } }, set: { maxLength: 1 } },
        ],
    },
}
```

A block that isn't an `object_list` item yields an unset `@index`, so comparisons are simply false (never an error). `lt: 1` is "first"; `lt: 2` is "first two", etc.

Field paths: `../field` for the parent block's field (and `@index` / `../@index` for position), `/field` for a page metadata field.

**Worked examples:** two blocks in the reference carry rules for their own reasons — the [Teaser Block](./examples/teaser.md) has nothing to ask for while it borrows the linked page's wording (`overwrite` off), and the [Image Block](./examples/image-block.md) offers no size for a full-width image, written as a list of rules with a bare `false` as the catch-all.

## Block Conversion & fieldMappings

`fieldMappings` (plural) on a block config defines how fields map between block types (and from linked content). This enables:

- **"Convert to..." UI action** — editors can convert a block to another type (e.g. teaser → image).
- **Listing item types** — query results are mapped to item blocks via `@default` (see [Listings](listings.md)).
- **Synchronised container children** — a parent controls child type, all children convert together (see [Container Blocks › Synchronised Block Types](container-blocks.md#synchronised-block-types-in-a-container)).
- **Drag / paste via conversion** — a block can be dropped or pasted into a container that only accepts a *convertible* type; it's converted on drop (see below).
- **Copy from a linked target** — a block pulls fields from the content item its link field points at, with a per-field linked/custom toggle (see [`@target`](#target--copy-from-a-linked-content-item)).

Each key in `fieldMappings` is either a **specific block type name**, **`@default`**, or **`@target`**.

**Worked example:** [Teaser Block](./examples/teaser.md) — `@default` mappings, so a converted or dragged block keeps its title, description and image.

### `@default` — the canonical content shape

`@default` is a virtual type representing a linked content item's fields — anything a catalog **search** returns as metadata (`metadata_fields: '_all'`): `@id`, `title`, `description`, `image`, `Subject` (tags), `created`/`effective` dates, and so on. A block with `fieldMappings['@default']` is saying "I can be populated from a content item." The keys are content/metadata field names — not this block's own field names (e.g. `label`, `field`, `required` are not content metadata and are invalid).

### Explicit type-to-type mappings

Use these when blocks share fields that aren't part of the `@default` set — for example, facet types sharing `{ title, field, hidden }` or form field types sharing `{ label, description, required }`.

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
// Content item types: use @default (canonical fields) + explicit cross-mappings
teaser: {
    fieldMappings: {
        '@default': { '@id': 'href', 'title': 'title', 'image': 'preview_image' },
        image: { 'href': 'href', 'alt': 'title', 'url': 'preview_image' },
    },
},
image: {
    fieldMappings: {
        '@default': { '@id': 'href', 'title': 'alt', 'image': 'url' },
        teaser: { 'href': 'href', 'title': 'alt', 'preview_image': 'url' },
    },
},

// Non-content types: use explicit hub-type mappings (NOT @default).
// All facet types map through checkboxFacet as a hub:
selectFacet:  { fieldMappings: { checkboxFacet: { title: 'title', field: 'field', hidden: 'hidden' } } },
checkboxFacet: { fieldMappings: { selectFacet: { /* ... */ }, daterangeFacet: { /* ... */ } } },
```

### `@target` — copy from a linked content item

`@target` maps a **linked** content item's attributes onto this block's own
fields — the generic version of the Volto teaser's "copy from target" button.
It maps *source content attributes* (`title`, `description`, `image`, …) to
*this block's fields*. The item is whichever the block's **link field** points at
(the `object_browser mode: 'link'` field — its stored snapshot is the source), so
you don't name a URL field separately: "the url is the link in the mapping".

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
button: {
    // The Label (title) syncs from the linked item's title.
    fieldMappings: {
        '@target': {
            title: 'title',
            description: 'description',
            // image: the conversion is derived from the destination field's
            // widget, so the value is assembled into the shape it expects.
            image: 'preview_image',
        },
    },
},
```

Declaring `@target` is the **only** opt-in — no per-block enhancer wiring. Each
mapped field then shows a small **🔗 pull from linked** toggle in the sidebar
(only when a target is selected). Every mapped field is one of two states:

- **Linked** (default, toggle ticked) — the field *pulls from the linked item*.
  Its value is filled from the target's snapshot when the page opens for editing
  and re-pulled when you change the link, so it always mirrors the linked content.
- **Custom** (toggle unticked) — your own value, ignored by the target. A field
  becomes custom the moment you edit it, or when you untick the toggle;
  re-ticking re-pulls the target value. Custom fields are recorded in the block's
  `_customFields` array (absence ⇒ linked), so the state persists with the block.

### Container ⇄ value (region-crossing paths)

A `fieldMappings` value is usually a sibling **field name**. It may instead be a
**region-crossing path** `<region>/<type|*>/<field>`, which reaches the `<field>`
of a container region's children — the one place the path grammar crosses a region
boundary. This bridges a **container** block (a region of child blocks) and a
**value** block (a scalar field), so a block can convert between the two shapes:

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
tableHeaderCell: {                                   // the value form: one slate
    blockSchema: { properties: { value: { widget: 'slate' } } },
    // Declared ONCE on the value block; works both directions.
    fieldMappings: { tableCell: { value: 'blocks/slate/value' } },
},
tableCell: {                                         // the container form
    blockSchema: { properties: {
        blocks: { widget: 'object_list', typeField: '@type',
                  allowedBlocks: ['slate', 'image', 'video'] },
    } },
},
```

- **container → value (collapse)** — gather the region's matching children's
  `<field>`; slate values are **merged** into one (lossless), not truncated.
- **value → container (expand)** — wrap the value in **one** child of `<type>` in
  the region.
- `<type>` selects a child type; `*` = any child that exposes `<field>` (siblings
  without it — an `image` for a `value` path — are skipped). A **concrete** type
  (`blocks/slate/value`) makes expand unambiguous, so use it for a two-way bridge;
  `*` suits read-only cross-region reads (e.g. a `when` condition).

Non-region scalar fields (`key`, `width`, …) carry over unchanged. This is the
`convertValueContainer` helper; DnD/paste and the block chooser reuse it via the
same `fieldMappings` graph. See `proposals/container-value-conversion.md`.

#### `typeRule` — position picks a typed item's `@type`

The bridge converts on demand; a **`@type` rule** on a typed `object_list` field
decides *when*, by **position**. It is an ordinary `when`-based fieldRule (same
grammar — `@index`, `../@index`, `../../<field>`, `oneOf`, `lt`, …) whose `set` is a
block-**type name** instead of a field definition:

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
cells: {
    widget: 'object_list', typeField: '@type',
    allowedBlocks: ['tableCell', 'tableHeaderCell'],
    typeRule: [
        // header row OR header column → the value form
        { when: { '../../headerMode': { oneOf: ['row', 'both'] }, '../@index': { lt: 1 } }, set: 'tableHeaderCell' },
        { when: { '../../headerMode': { oneOf: ['col', 'both'] }, '@index': { lt: 1 } },     set: 'tableHeaderCell' },
        { set: 'tableCell' },                                // otherwise the container form
    ],
},
```

The rule is evaluated in the same pass that applies field defaults (run on every
edit): each typed item's target `@type` is re-resolved, and when it differs from the
stored `@type` the item is **converted in place** via the bridge above. So moving a
row to/from row 0 flips its cells between `tableHeaderCell` (a slate `value`) and
`tableCell` (a `blocks` container), losslessly — no imperative "re-type the cells"
code. Only meaningful on a **typed** object_list (a `typeField` item has an `@type`
to rewrite); it settles in one pass (the target type re-resolves to itself once the
item is in place).

Each field's value is converted to the shape its destination widget expects
(derived from the widget): strings copy across, an image field is assembled from
the target's `image_scales` / `image_field`, multi-value fields (e.g. `Subject` →
tags) pass through as-is.

The pull is **snapshot-based** — there is no separate live fetch. When you pick
or type a link, the url widget stores the target's **full** metadata onto the
link field (the object browser already fetches every item with
`metadata_fields: '_all'`, and the field's `selectedItemAttrs` keeps the whole
canonical set), so the block carries its own source data. Every mapped field then
pulls straight from that stored snapshot: **on page open** (all blocks fill at
once) and again whenever you change the link.

Only an **internal** link is a pull source. An external URL has no catalog item
to search, so a field linked to one can't pull — the toggle is hidden and the
field behaves as a plain editable field. (Unfurling external links via
OpenGraph is a future enhancement.)

### Conversion graph rules

- Explicit `fieldMappings[typeName]` always creates a conversion edge.
- `@default` only creates edges between types that both have valid `@default` mappings (keys from `{ @id, title, description, image }`). Types with non-canonical `@default` keys are ignored.
- Types without `fieldMappings` never appear in the "Convert to..." menu.
- Transitive conversions use paths through intermediate types (e.g. hero → teaser → image).
- Unmapped fields are kept in the data so converting back restores them.

### Drag / paste via conversion

The same conversion graph gives drag-and-drop (and paste) more valid destinations: a block can be dropped or pasted into a container whose `allowedBlocks` only admits a type the block can *convert* to.

**Every drop/paste is TRIALLED before it commits.** The candidate result is normalised (the same pass that applies field defaults and evaluates [`@type` rules](#typerule--position-picks-a-typed-items-type)), then each block's `@type` is diffed against what was dropped. If **anything** converted — because the dropped block had to convert to fit the container, **or** because a rule re-typed a block by its new position (e.g. a table row moved to row 0 turns its cells into header cells) — a **"Convert blocks?"** confirm lists each `from → to` and waits: **Convert** commits the already-converted result, **Cancel** aborts the whole drop. Nothing converted → it commits silently.

The chooser popup survives only for the genuinely ambiguous case: a single block reachable to *several* target types, where you pick which one (cancelling leaves it untouched). Zero reachable types rejects the drop; multi-block selections are auto-only (every member must reach exactly one type). On mobile, conversion happens via cut → paste (drag/chevron move stays native-only). External-link and other type restrictions are unaffected; only the container's `allowedBlocks` gate is relaxed to "allowed or convertible".

### Mapping value format

A mapping value is either a string (simple field rename) or `{ field, type }` (rename with type conversion):

<!-- codeExample: json -->
```json
{
    "@id": { "field": "href", "type": "link" },
    "title": "title",
    "description": "description",
    "image": "preview_image"
}
```

When `type` is specified, the value is converted at runtime:

| Type | Conversion |
|------|------------|
| `string` | Arrays joined with `", "`; image objects resolved to URL string |
| `link` | String wrapped as `[{ "@id": value }]` (Volto link format) |
| `image` | Pass through (expects `{ "@id", image_field, image_scales }`) |
| `array` | Non-arrays wrapped in `[value]` |
| `(none)` | Copied as-is |

### FieldMappingWidget

When a parent block has `mappingField` set in its `inheritSchemaFrom` recipe, the admin sidebar shows a widget that lets editors configure field mappings visually:

- Shows the `@default` source fields (`@id`, `title`, `description`, `image`) on the left.
- For each source field, lets the editor pick a field from the selected child type's schema.
- Auto-detects the conversion `type` from the target field definition (e.g. `object_browser` with `mode=link` → `type: "link"`).
- Saves the result as `fieldMapping` (singular) on the block data.

The saved `fieldMapping` is read at render time by `expandListingBlocks` — no block registry access needed at render time.

## HTML Paste Support (TODO)

When the editor pastes rich HTML into the page, Hydra will eventually be able to recognise it as a custom block by matching against a CSS selector mapping. The proposed shape:

<!-- codeExample: javascript -->
```javascript
video: {
    fieldMappings: {
        'css:video': { 'src': 'url', 'caption[@class="alt"]': 'alt' },
    },
}
```

The `css:<selector>` key in `fieldMappings` matches a pasted HTML element; the value maps element attributes to block fields. Not yet implemented — open question on whether this should run via `htmlTagsToSlate` (bypassing slate conversion) or be encoded into slate so attributes/classes survive.
