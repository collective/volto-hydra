# Selecting blocks

The editor has two modes when a block is selected: **text mode** (you're editing inside the block) and **block mode** (the whole block is selected as a unit).

## Text mode

Click on a block in the preview. If the frontend marks any of its fields as inline-editable, the cursor goes into that field and you can start typing.

- A subtle border appears around the block.
- The field you're editing gets a faint underline.
- The Quanta toolbar appears above the block (formatting, convert-to, delete, etc.).
- The sidebar switches to that block's settings.

## Block mode

Press `Escape` to leave text editing. The block stays selected, but you're no longer inside any specific field.

- A full border appears around the block (visually stronger than the text-mode hint).
- Keyboard shortcuts now operate on the whole block:
  - **Arrow Up / Down** — move selection to the previous / next sibling block (container-aware: jumps into and out of containers).
  - **Enter** — add a new block after this one.
  - **Delete / Backspace** — remove the selected block.

Press `Escape` again to **deselect** (or go up to the parent container if this block is inside one). Each `Escape` walks one step up the hierarchy.

<block type="image">

</block>

## Multi-selection

You can select multiple blocks at once and operate on the group.

<block type="slateTable" table.fixed table.celled>

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| **Shift+Click** (in block mode) | Select range from currently-selected block to the clicked one |
| **Ctrl+Click / Cmd+Click** (any mode) | Toggle the clicked block in/out of the selection |
| **Shift+Arrow Up/Down** (block mode) | Extend or shrink the selection by one block |
| Plain click | Clears multi-selection, selects only the clicked block |

</block>

While multiple blocks are selected:

- A combined bounding box is drawn around them.
- `Delete` / `Backspace` removes all of them.
- The Quanta toolbar dropdown offers actions that apply to all (e.g. "Wrap in...", see [Containers](containers.md)).
- The sidebar shows the count and lists each selected block by type.

## Selecting from the sidebar

The sidebar is the other way to navigate selection — useful when the block you want is offscreen, buried inside a paged container (e.g. a specific slide of a slider), or you just prefer keyboard / pointer nav over hunting in the preview.

### The parent chain (going up)

When a block is selected, the sidebar shows the **chain of parent containers** from the root down to the block — one collapsible section per level. Each level has a `‹` arrow on the left.

### Text

```text
‹ Columns          ← click ‹ to deselect (go to page level)
   [Columns settings]
   ‹ Column        ← click ‹ to select Columns
      [Column settings]
      ‹ Text       ← current block, highlighted
         [Text body, …]
```

Click any `‹` arrow to **navigate up** to that level. This does the same thing as pressing `Escape` repeatedly, but visibly — you can see what each parent is named, jump several levels in one click, and edit the parent's own settings (alignment, padding, …) inline without leaving the current selection.

<block type="image" url="/docs/images/parent-chain" align="center" size="l" data-json='{"alt":"Sidebar showing parent chain for a slate inside a column inside columns. Three sections each with a `‹` arrow: Columns (\"My Columns Section\"), Column (\"Left Column\"), Text (current, body field shown)."}' />

This works for any depth — nested columns, slider with templated children, accordion inside a section inside the page. The chain reflects the real DOM hierarchy.

### The children list (going down)

When a container block is selected, the sidebar shows that container's **children** as a list, one row per child:

### Text

```text
Slides                    [+]
⋮⋮  Slide 1                >
⋮⋮  Slide 2                >
⋮⋮  Slide 3                >
```

- **`⋮⋮` drag handle** — drag to reorder children within the container.
- **`>` drill-in arrow** — selects that child, scrolls the preview to it, switches the sidebar to its settings.
- **`[+]` add button** — opens the BlockChooser to add a new child to that field.

If the container has multiple blocks fields (e.g. a header field and a body field), each appears as a separate section with its own children list and add button.

<block type="image" url="/docs/images/children-list" align="center" size="l" data-json='{"alt":"Sidebar with a search container selected, showing two children-list sections — Facets (with three facet rows) and Results Listing (with one Listing row). Each row has a `⋮⋮` drag handle and a `>` drill-in arrow; each section has a `+` add button."}' />

### Picking from the outline (for paged containers)

Some containers paginate their children — a slider only renders the active slide; an accordion only the expanded panel. Use the children list to pick a slide / panel that's not currently visible — the preview scrolls and pages to it automatically.

## Selecting page-level fields

The page itself has metadata fields (title, description, preview image). Some are inline-editable in the preview (e.g. clicking the rendered `<h1>` to edit the page title); all are editable from the sidebar when no block is selected.
