/**
 * Auto-discovered block sanity tests.
 *
 * Reads .discovered-blocks.json (written by globalSetup) and generates
 * one test per block @type. Each test loads the page containing the block
 * via mock-parent's ?api_path= and runs verifyBlockRendering.
 *
 * Run with:
 *   DISCOVER_BLOCKS_API=<mock-api-url> pnpm exec playwright test block-sanity
 *
 * Env vars:
 *   DISCOVER_BLOCKS_API  - Plone API URL for discovery and content fetching
 *   MOCK_PARENT_URL      - URL of mock-parent.html (defaults to test-frontend port)
 *   CONTAINMENT_EXEMPT_SLOTS
 *                        - comma-separated template slot ids where a block may
 *                          sit outside its container's allowedBlocks on purpose
 *                          (e.g. a docs site's component showcase slot). See
 *                          readContainmentRules in helpers/discover-blocks.cjs.
 *
 * Works against any Plone API — mock or remote.
