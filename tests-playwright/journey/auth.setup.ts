/**
 * Sign in ONCE per run and save the session for every spec that follows.
 *
 * Signing in inside each spec cost about fifty seconds apiece against
 * WordPress — the login page, the consent page, and the reload after them —
 * which is most of why a "focused" test took four minutes. A focused test
 * should reach its subject in seconds; the login is setup, and setup belongs
 * in a fixture.
 *
 * The credential lives in the PROXY frame's origin storage, so what is saved
 * here is that origin's localStorage, not a cookie. Later specs load it and
 * the proxy comes up already authenticated — the sign-in panel never appears.
