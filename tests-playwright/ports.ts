/**
 * Central source of truth for test infrastructure ports.
 *
 * Every test, helper, and playwright config should import from here
 * instead of hard-coding `localhost:NNNN`.
 *
 * THERE ARE NO DEFAULTS. Every port must be given as HYDRA_<NAME>_PORT, and a
 * missing one is a hard failure rather than a quiet fall back to 8888/3001.
 *
 * The defaults were the problem. A checkout that ran playwright directly bound
 * the historical numbers, which are shared with every other hydra checkout on
 * the machine — so one run would take over, or quietly talk to, another
 * project's servers. Nothing in the output said so; the ports simply worked
 * until the day they belonged to someone else.
 *
 * Callers therefore say which ports they mean:
 *   - from a consuming repo: its make target exports its own block
 *     (`make hydra-test ARGS="<spec> --project=admin-mock"`)
 *   - in this repo: the CI workflow and package.json scripts set them
 *
 *
 * Keep the keys here aligned with package.json's start:* scripts and
 * the build job's "Start servers" step in .github/workflows/test.yaml.
 *
 * Not in scope: URLs embedded as DATA inside fixture JSON
 * (tests-playwright/fixtures/content/*\/data.json) — those are
 * historical site URLs in saved content, not infrastructure config.
