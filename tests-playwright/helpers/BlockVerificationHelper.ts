/**
 * Schema-INDEPENDENT coverage check: every block/field the frontend actually
 * renders as editable must be known to the bridge's blockPathMap.
 *
 * `checkSubBlocks` walks the OTHER direction (pathMap → DOM: "is every block
 * the pathMap knows about rendered?"). That direction is blind to an
 * incomplete schema: if a frontend registers e.g. `slateTable` with an empty
 * schema, buildBlockPathMap can't see `table → rows → cells`, so the cells are
 * simply ABSENT from the pathMap — yet the frontend still renders them from
 * data. pathMap → DOM then iterates nothing and passes, while the cells are
 * un-selectable / un-editable / un-navigable (no pathInfo → parentAddMode
 * undefined, field type unresolved). That is precisely how an incomplete
 * schema slipped through to a silent table-navigation failure.
 *
 * This check closes the gap by walking DOM → pathMap: for the rendered block
 * subtree, assert every nested `[data-block-uid]` has a pathMap entry. It needs
 * no blocksConfig — it reads the live bridge — so it runs in CI unconditionally
 * (unlike the schema-driven discovery checks, which are gated on MOCK_PARENT_URL
 * and traverse schema-first, so they can't see missing nested structure).
 *
 * Scope, to stay false-positive-free:
 *  - Only rendered `[data-block-uid]`s are checked (a concrete "this is an
 *    editable block" signal). We deliberately do NOT flag unresolved
 *    `data-edit-*` fields: page-level fields (`/title`) and listing-projected
 *    block fields (a teaser inside a grid) legitimately render edit
 *    annotations that aren't in THIS block's editable pathMap.
 *  - Read-only subtrees (`data-block-readonly` — listing results, teasers) are
 *    skipped: their inner markup is projected content, not editable blocks.
 *  - Items that reuse the parent's uid (listing expansion) are skipped.
