/**
 * Revealing a block nested BELOW the container that publishes the handle.
 *
 * A container advertises what it can reveal with `data-block-selector`, and the
 * accordion lists its panel's uid plus that panel's DIRECT children. A block one
 * level deeper — here a slate inside a grid inside the panel — appears in no
 * such list, so nothing in the DOM claims to be able to show it.
 *
 * The +1/-1 fallback cannot cover this either: it needs the target element
 * already rendered, and a closed panel's contents are hidden.
 *
 * The bridge resolves it by walking up blockPathMap from the target to the
 * nearest ancestor that DID publish a handle, and clicking that.
