/**
 * ImageWidget sibling preservation on save — regression guard.
 *
 * When a block schema declares an `image` field with `widget: 'image'`,
 * Hydra's ImageWidget storage convention is:
 *
 *   block.image        = "<url string>"
 *   block.image_field  = "image"                 (sibling)
 *   block.image_scales = { image: [...scales] }  (sibling)
 *
 * The two sibling fields carry the brain metadata needed for the frontend
 * to build srcset URLs from Plone's standard scale set. Without them, the
 * frontend has only an opaque URL and can't do responsive image loading.
 *
 * On pretagovsite-frontend.fly.dev we observed homepage hero saves landing
 * with `block.image` = string URL but BOTH siblings missing. That bug is
 * NOT reproducible against current main (most likely fixed upstream in the
 * Volto 19 upgrade, #220). This test locks in the good behavior so any
 * future regression on the save path is caught.
 *
 * Fixture page:
 *   /_test_data/image-widget-siblings-test
 * has a hero block pre-populated with `image` + `image_field` + `image_scales`.
 * We open it in admin, touch the heading so the hero block lands in the PATCH,
 * save, and assert all three fields are present in the captured PATCH body.
 *
 * NOTE on the heading touch: Volto omits unchanged fields from PATCH bodies.
 * Without a touch, the PATCH only ever carries `footer_blocks: {items: []}`
 * and we can't observe whether the bridge would have dropped the siblings.
 * The heading touch (type+delete) returns the value to its original text but
 * marks the block dirty.
