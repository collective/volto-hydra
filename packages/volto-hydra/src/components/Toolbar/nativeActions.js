/**
 * Entries the CMS answers for itself, picked out of Volto's actions store.
 *
 * A plain module rather than a helper inside the plug, because importing the
 * plug drags in Volto's store and nothing about this needs React. It had no
 * tests while it lived there, which is how it came to read the wrong two
 * fields.
 *
 * The shape is Plone's, since that is what the store holds by the time it gets
 * here: `url` carries the destination, and the site category is `site_actions`.
 * Verified against a live Plone 6 — tests-adapters/fixtures/plone/.
