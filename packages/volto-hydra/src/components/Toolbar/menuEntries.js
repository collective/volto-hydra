/**
 * The state menu's entries: one list of things that change what this document
 * is and who can reach it.
 *
 * Named to not collide with StateMenu.jsx. It was `stateMenu.js`, which differs
 * from the component only by case — fine on Linux, and on macOS webpack
 * resolved `./StateMenu` to THIS file, because .js is tried before .jsx. The
 * component then had no default export and the build broke in a way that named
 * neither file as the problem.
 *
 * Plone keeps workflow, sharing and working copies in three separate screens.
 * They answer one question — who can do what, when — so they are one list here,
 * and every entry opens a dialog that says what it will do before it does it.
 *
 * Pure, so the rules below are testable without mounting a toolbar.
