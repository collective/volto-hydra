/**
 * The CMS's own screens, listed.
 *
 * Each entry opens where the ADAPTER said it should. That decision is not ours
 * to make at click time: whether a page can be framed is settled by headers we
 * cannot read from here — wp-admin sends X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN, and a
 * Hydra admin is never on the CMS's origin — and a refused frame arrives blank,
 * with nothing to tell the user. So 'window' is the default and 'iframe' is the
 * adapter opting in for a CMS it knows allows it.
 *
 * rel="noopener": these open the CMS with the user's own session, and a page
 * that can reach back through window.opener is a page that can navigate the
 * admin out from under them.
