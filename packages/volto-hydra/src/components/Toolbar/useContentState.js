/**
 * The current document's state and the forms its transitions ask for.
 *
 * Two intents, fetched at different times on purpose. `state.get` is cheap and
 * runs whenever the document changes; `state.getForms` is only fetched when the
 * menu opens, because the expensive part of it — who currently has access — is
 * a second request the CMS does not make for free.
 *
 * These go straight down the bridge rather than through the Plone-REST
 * emulation. `state.getForms` has no Plone endpoint to emulate: the adapter
 * composes it out of @workflow and @sharing, and a CMS on the http passthrough
 * would send an invented URL to a real Plone and get a 404.
