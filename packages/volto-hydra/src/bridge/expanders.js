/**
 * The expander bundle, and who it is worth enabling for.
 *
 * Volto's apiExpanders declare that these arrive embedded in the content
 * response: components skip their own fetch (hasApiExpander) and the reducers
 * read content['@components'].
 *
 * Enabled ONLY for adapters whose CMS expands natively, because for anyone
 * else it measurably costs more than it saves. An emulating adapter answers an
 * expansion by issuing the same intents itself, so the request count cannot go
 * down — and it goes UP, because Volto's reducers cache navigation, types and
 * actions in the store and skip re-fetching them, while expansion re-requests
 * the whole bundle on every content GET. Measured on the Drupal journey:
 * 190 requests without, 214 with, wall clock unchanged.
 *
 * Native expanders pay because the bundle rides along in a request that was
 * being made anyway: five route requests collapse into one.
 *
 * Retested once the adapters cached reads properly, on the theory that the
 * extra breadcrumbs/navigation/types an expansion asks for would then be free.
 * They are not: ungated, the Drupal journey went from 1.5 minutes to 6.9 and
 * failed. Caching removes the duplicate READS, but expansion still fans every
 * content GET out into four more intents, and on an emulating adapter that is
 * four more things to go wrong per route rather than four fewer requests.
 *
 * The list is EXACTLY what the contract can serve. navroot and translations
 * stay off deliberately: hasApiExpander would report them as expanded, the
 * component would skip its own fetch, and the data would never arrive.
