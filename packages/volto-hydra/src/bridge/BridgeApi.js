/**
 * Drop-in replacement for Volto's Api helper that routes every call over the
 * Hydra bridge instead of fetching the CMS directly.
 *
 * Same five methods, same argument shape, so the api middleware, the ~30 URL
 * templates in the action creators, and every reducer stay untouched — only
 * the transport changes.
 *
 * Two transports live behind that interface:
 *
 *   passthrough — the request's Plone path is forwarded verbatim. Only an
 *     adapter advertising `http-passthrough` can serve it, and for Plone it
 *     reproduces today's behaviour exactly, which is what makes the
 *     transparency proof meaningful.
 *
 *   semantic — the path is translated to a canonical intent and the result
 *     translated back. This is what lets a CMS that has never heard of
 *     /@querystring answer the query builder.
 *
 * The adapter picks, by what it advertises. Routing per request rather than per
 * adapter matters because coverage is partial: /@history has no canonical form
 * yet, so it must still reach a passthrough adapter rather than fail.
