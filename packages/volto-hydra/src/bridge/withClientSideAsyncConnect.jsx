/**
 * Run a route component's asyncConnect promises on the CLIENT.
 *
 * Volto attaches route-level data loading to components as `reduxAsyncConnect`
 * and relies on `loadOnServer` to run it during SSR; ReduxAsyncConnect then
 * does not re-run it for the initial page load, because the data is already in
 * the serialised store. A bridge-backed admin has no server-side CMS, so that
 * pass never happens and nothing else takes it up — the data is simply never
 * fetched, on either side.
 *
 * Contents is where that showed: it renders <Unauthorized/> unless
 * `objectActions` is populated, so the listing came back correct and the panel
 * still said the user could not see it.
 *
 * App-level asyncConnect already had this problem solved, by making its
 * promises run when `useBridgeBackend` is set (see loadsInThisEnvironment in
 * the App customization). This is the same fix for a route component.
